# Why don't I like Python anymore?

I used Python from before I begin my career as a software developer, and it have been my main language for a long time (relative to my career). I have used it for many different things, from REST APIs, data engineering, data analysis, and even web development, it also have built some personal projects for fun, like a Interpreter for a language I created, and a library for use techniques of functional programming in Python. But with the time it have been losing my interest, because the abstractions that it offers are not right for me, and looking for other languages I found that there are better options for me.

## The problem with Python

Python is a great language, it have a lot of support, libraries, community, and it is easy to learn, but this last thing is a half-truth, because it is easy to learn the principles of programming with Python, but this languages now have a lot of features that are not easy to learn, eg: decorators, context managers, metaclasses, and a lot of built-in functions that are not easy to understand. And this is without mention the libraries and the management of dependencies, because we have to worry about virtual environments, different versions of Python, the compatibilities between versions, etc.

<!-- Points to talk:
- A lot of features, it is a frankenstein language
- Not easy to learn all the features
- Not simple to manage dependencies
- Not consistent, eg: value by reference and value by copy, modification of objects, etc.
- All is an object, and all can be modified
- The maintenance of the code is not easy
- It is really easy to write bad code
- The management of dependencies is not easy
- The performance is not the best
- The language is not expressive
- The language is not safe
- Not allow compose functions in a easy way

### The Frankenstein language

The first thing that I going to highlight is that Python have a lot of features, and with the time it have been adding more and more features, and this is not a bad thing...

### Not easy to learn all the features

### Not simple to manage dependencies

### Not consistent

### All is an object, and all can be modified

### The maintenance of the code is not easy

### It is really easy to write bad code

### The management of dependencies is not easy

### The performance is not the best

### The language is not expressive

### The language is not safe

### Compose procedures is not easy

## Alternatives?

Exist a lot of alternatives, but what does we with all code that we have written in Python? To be honest, I think that change the language going to be almost impossible, the resistance to change is too big, and the cost of change is too high. If we look other cases, like Cobol, Perl, Visual Basic, PHP, etc. We can see that it is live and kicking, and the reason is that the cost of change is too high in comparison with the cost of maintain the code in the same language.



## Conclusion

I admit that I am not a software developer with 20 years of experience under my belt, and perhaps
